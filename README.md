Professional Programming Project:

This app was done for my final project in college. I always wanted to learn about app development so this worked out well. 

At the beginning of this project, I was following a couple of tutorials. With these tutorials, I had a lot of errors that were preventing me from making major progress and getting to my customization part of the app. Since this was new to me I was very unaware of the errors I was finding and some of them were simple syntax errors but others were more serious. Some errors did not show up in the terminal but I could see in my app that the changes were not being made like they were shown in the tutorial. After going through this same issue with a couple of tutorials I started using Chat gpt to help with those errors. This helped out a lot to not only explain the errors but give tips on how to fix the error. This was a major step since I was finally able to finish a tutorial and start customizing the app to my idea.

My original idea was to create a food ordering app, similar to how the Mcdonald's app works but I would build it to incorporate a local business instead. In my original idea, I also wanted to have separate screens for a rewards page and a personal account page as well. Another error that prevented this was the navigation functionality of React Native. This error was very tough to fix and even with research I was not able to get this to work so I had to change my idea a little as well. 

Lastly, I finally got to the finish line after adding in the "Add to Cart" and "Sort by Price" functions. There were still certain things that I was not too happy about like the user interface since it felt pretty crowded but I was not able to work around this since the navigation was not working. I also wanted to make the add-to-cart section freeze at the bottom of the screen and only have one section for all items rather than two sections for each section. These are things I would like to work on in the future if I continue with this project but I would want to figure out the navigation error first.
